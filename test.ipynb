A flip-flop is a binary cell, which stores 1-bit of \\ninformation. It itself is a sequential circuit. By now we know that flip-flop can change \\nits state when clock pulse occurs but when? Generally, a flip-flop can change its state \\nwhen the clocks transitions from 0 to I (rising edge) or from 1 to 0 (falling edge) and \\nnot when clock is 1. If the storage element changes its state when clock is exactly at 1 \\nthen it is called latch. In simple words, flip-flop is edge-triggered and latch is level- \\ntriggered. \\n8 8\\n\\npage_label: 90\\nfile_path: d:\\\\Machine learning\\\\Generative AI\\\\Llama Index\\\\data\\\\Block-1_merged.pdf\\n\\n.......................... \\nSl AVC \\nFigure 4.9: Muter - Slave flip flop \\nNote: Master-slave flip-flop can be constructed using D or SR flip-flop in the same \\nmanner. \\nNow, let us summarize the working of this flip-flop: \\n(i) When the clock pulse is 0, the master flip-flop is disabled but the slave \\nbecomes active and it's output Q & 6 becomes equal to Y and Y \\nrespectively. Why? Well the possible combination of the value of Y and Y' \\nare either Y=l , Y -0 or Y=O Y =l. Thus, the slave flip-flop can have \\nfollowing combinations: - \\n(a) J=I, K4 which means Q= 1, =O (stet fl ipflop) \\n(b) J=O, K= 1 which means Q=0, Q =I (clear flipflop) \\n(ii) When inputs are applied at JK and clock pulse becomes 1, only master gets \\nactivated resulting in intermediate output Y going to state 0 or 1 depending on \\nthe input and previous state. Remember that during this time slave is also \\nmaintaining its'previous state only. As the clock pulse becomes 0, the master \\nbecomes inactive and slave acquires the same state as master as explained in (a) \\nand (b) conditions above. \\nBut why do we require this master-slave combination? To understand this, consider a \\nsituation where output of one flipflop is going to be input of other flip-flop. Here, the \\nassumption is that clock pulse inputs of all flipflops are synchronized and occur at the \\nsame time. The change of state of master occurs when the clock pulse goes to 1 but \\nduring that time the output of slave still has not changed, thus the state of the flip- \\nflops in the system can be changed simultaneously during the same clock pulse even \\nthough output of flip-flops are connected to the inputs of other flipflops. \\n4.3.4 Edge-Triggered flip-flops \\nAn edge-triggered flipflop is used to synchronize the state change duringa clock \\npulse transition instead of constant level. Some edge-triggered flipflops trigger on the \\nrising edge (0 to 1 transition) whereas others trigger on the falling edge (1- to 0 \\ntransition).

In simple words, flip-flop is edge-triggered and latch is level- \\ntriggered. \\n8 8\\n\\npage_label: 90\\nfile_path: d:\\\\Machine learning\\\\Generative AI\\\\Llama Index\\\\data\\\\Block-1_merged.pdf\\n\\n.......................... \\nSl AVC \\nFigure 4.9: Muter - Slave flip flop \\nNote: Master-slave flip-flop can be constructed using D or SR flip-flop in the same \\nmanner. \\nNow, let us summarize the working of this flip-flop: \\n(i) When the clock pulse is 0, the master flip-flop is disabled but the slave \\nbecomes active and it's output Q & 6 becomes equal to Y and Y \\nrespectively. Why? Well the possible combination of the value of Y and Y' \\nare either Y=l , Y -0 or Y=O Y =l. Thus, the slave flip-flop can have \\nfollowing combinations: - \\n(a) J=I, K4 which means Q= 1, =O (stet fl ipflop) \\n(b) J=O, K= 1 which means Q=0, Q =I (clear flipflop) \\n(ii) When inputs are applied at JK and clock pulse becomes 1, only master gets \\nactivated resulting in intermediate output Y going to state 0 or 1 depending on \\nthe input and previous state. Remember that during this time slave is also \\nmaintaining its'previous state only. As the clock pulse becomes 0, the master \\nbecomes inactive and slave acquires the same state as master as explained in (a) \\nand (b) conditions above. \\nBut why do we require this master-slave combination? To understand this, consider a \\nsituation where output of one flipflop is going to be input of other flip-flop. Here, the \\nassumption is that clock pulse inputs of all flipflops are synchronized and occur at the \\nsame time. The change of state of master occurs when the clock pulse goes to 1 but \\nduring that time the output of slave still has not changed, thus the state of the flip- \\nflops in the system can be changed simultaneously during the same clock pulse even \\nthough output of flip-flops are connected to the inputs of other flipflops. \\n4.3.4 Edge-Triggered flip-flops \\nAn edge-triggered flipflop is used to synchronize the state change duringa clock \\npulse transition instead of constant level. Some edge-triggered flipflops trigger on the \\nrising edge (0 to 1 transition) whereas others trigger on the falling edge (1- to 0 \\ntransition).

Once the decoder selects the word, the readlwrite \\ninput tells the operation. This is derived using an OR gate, since all the non-selected \\ncells will produce a zero output.

When the output is \\nQ=l &Q =0, the latch is said to be in the set state. When Q=O &Q =1, it is the reset I state. Normally, The outputs Q &G are complement of each other.

As soon as S=l, the \\noutput of NOR gate 'b' goes to 0 i.e. Q becomes 0 and almost immediately Q \\nbecomes 1 as both the inputs (6 & R) to NOR gate 'a' become 0.

On changing R to 1, Q changes to \\n0 irrespective of the state of flip-flop and as Q is 0 & S is 0 then 6 becomes 1. I \\nEven after R returns to 0, Q remains 0 i.e. latch is in clear state. \\niii) When both S & R go to 1 simultaneously, the two outputs go to 0.

Asynchronous sequential circuits may be regarded as combinational \\ncircuit with feedback path.

The storage \\nelements can change their state only when a clock pulse occurs. Sequential circuits \\nthat have clock pulses as input to flip-flops are called clocked sequential circuit. \\n4.3 FLIP-FLOPS \\nLet us see flip-flops in detail. A flip-flop is a binary cell, which stores 1-bit of \\ninformation. It itself is a sequential circuit. By now we know that flip-flop can change \\nits state when clock pulse occurs but when? Generally, a flip-flop can change its state \\nwhen the clocks transitions from 0 to I (rising edge) or from 1 to 0 (falling edge) and \\nnot when clock is 1. If the storage element changes its state when clock is exactly at 1 \\nthen it is called latch. In simple words, flip-flop is edge-triggered and latch is level- \\ntriggered. \\n8 8\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1997, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8193491871312951), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='6b2ba2b7-bfae-4b53-b523-2e7df268192b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '90', 'file_name': 'Block-1_merged.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Machine learning\\\\Generative AI\\\\Llama Index\\\\data\\\\Block-1_merged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 35858591, 'creation_date': '2024-06-13', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-02'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='bccb6b6c-a822-446c-840d-befb65c40076', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '90', 'file_name': 'Block-1_merged.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\Machine learning\\\\Generative AI\\\\Llama Index\\\\data\\\\Block-1_merged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 35858591, 'creation_date': '2024-06-13', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-02'}, hash='112a3273e542bc2a045076cddea68f9bc868ac747427e281829ed25796c3c4ae')}, text=\".......................... \\nSl AVC \\nFigure 4.9: Muter - Slave flip flop \\nNote: Master-slave flip-flop can be constructed using D or SR flip-flop in the same \\nmanner. \\nNow, let us summarize the working of this flip-flop: \\n(i) When the clock pulse is 0, the master flip-flop is disabled but the slave \\nbecomes active and it's output Q & 6 becomes equal to Y and Y \\nrespectively. Why? Well the possible combination of the value of Y and Y' \\nare either Y=l , Y -0 or Y=O Y =l. Thus, the slave flip-flop can have \\nfollowing combinations: - \\n(a) J=I, K4 which means Q= 1, =O (stet fl ipflop) \\n(b) J=O, K= 1 which means Q=0, Q =I (clear flipflop) \\n(ii) When inputs are applied at JK and clock pulse becomes 1, only master gets \\nactivated resulting in intermediate output Y going to state 0 or 1 depending on \\nthe input and previous state. Remember that during this time slave is also \\nmaintaining its'previous state only. As the clock pulse becomes 0, the master \\nbecomes inactive and slave acquires the same state as master as explained in (a) \\nand (b) conditions above. \\nBut why do we require this master-slave combination? To understand this, consider a \\nsituation where output of one flipflop is going to be input of other flip-flop. Here, the \\nassumption is that clock pulse inputs of all flipflops are synchronized and occur at the \\nsame time. The change of state of master occurs when the clock pulse goes to 1 but \\nduring that time the output of slave still has not changed, thus the state of the flip- \\nflops in the system can be changed simultaneously during the same clock pulse even \\nthough output of flip-flops are connected to the inputs of other flipflops. \\n4.3.4 Edge-Triggered flip-flops \\nAn edge-triggered flipflop is used to synchronize the state change duringa clock \\npulse transition instead of constant level. Some edge-triggered flipflops trigger on the \\nrising edge (0 to 1 transition) whereas others trigger on the falling edge (1- to 0 \\ntransition).

In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\n\\npage_label: 10\\nfile_path: d:\\\\Machine learning\\\\Generative AI\\\\Llama Index\\\\data\\\\attention.pdf\\n\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser Training WSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.
